 URL Mapping/Routing
 NB: Unless the Apache2/Nginx server is dealing with omitted trailing slashes
     the routes themselves have to handle them. Even if the Apache2/Nginx 
     server is handling trailing slashes, it won't hurt to have both versions
     of the routes defined here just in case something gets weird.
     This is only a big issue for login, logout, and upload. The other routes
      are hit via created URLs from Backbone, and are pretty compatable.
